# crypto_app
## Description
 A tool for encoding messages using the RSA method.
 
The RSA algorithm is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm; this means that it uses a public key and a private key (i.e two different, mathematically linked keys). As their names suggest, a public key is shared publicly, while a private key is secret and must not be shared with anyone.[more about RSA](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-the-rsa-algorithm)

## Quick start
